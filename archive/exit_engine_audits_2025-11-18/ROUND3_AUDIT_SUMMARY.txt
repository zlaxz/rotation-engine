TRANSACTION COST AUDIT - ROUND 3 SUMMARY
========================================

Date: 2025-11-18
Status: PRICING FIXED, MAJOR GAPS REMAIN
Grade: D+ (60/100)

WHAT GOT FIXED IN ROUND 2
--------------------------
✅ Bid/ask pricing logic correct
✅ Entry uses ask (long) / bid (short)
✅ Exit uses bid (long) / ask (short)
✅ No double-spread application

WHAT'S STILL BROKEN
-------------------
🔴 CRITICAL: Delta hedging costs missing ($87-218/trade)
🔴 CRITICAL: Polygon spread verification needed (crisis vs normal)
🔴 HIGH: Slippage missing (minor now, severe if scaling)

COST BREAKDOWN BY PROFILE
--------------------------
Profile 1 (Long Straddle 75 DTE):
  Current costs: $5.20
  Realistic:     $105-$145
  Missing:       -$100-$140 (HEDGING)
  Viability:     🟡 QUESTIONABLE

Profile 2 (Short-Dated Gamma 7 DTE):
  Current costs: $5.20
  Realistic:     $7-$12
  Missing:       -$2-$7
  Viability:     ✅ LIKELY VIABLE

Profile 3 (Short Straddle 30 DTE):
  Current costs: $5.20
  Realistic:     $140-$225
  Missing:       -$135-$220 (HEDGING)
  Viability:     🔴 UNPROFITABLE

Profile 4 (Long Call 60 DTE):
  Current costs: $5.20
  Realistic:     $6-$10
  Missing:       -$1-$5
  Viability:     ✅ VIABLE

Profile 5 (Long Put 45 DTE):
  Current costs: $5.20
  Realistic:     $6-$12
  Missing:       -$1-$7
  Viability:     ✅ VIABLE

Profile 6 (Long Straddle 30 DTE):
  Current costs: $5.20
  Realistic:     $95-$180
  Missing:       -$90-$175 (HEDGING)
  Viability:     🔴 LIKELY FAILS

EXPECTED DEGRADATION AFTER FIXES
---------------------------------
Profile 1: -66% to -97% (may survive if P&L > $150/trade)
Profile 2: -10% (minimal impact)
Profile 3: -100%+ (LOSING MONEY - theta < hedging cost)
Profile 4: -5% (directional, no hedging)
Profile 5: -8% (directional, no hedging)
Profile 6: -75% (likely unprofitable)

CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED
--------------------------
Priority 0 (THIS WEEK):
  [ ] Verify Polygon spreads widen during VIX spikes (4 hours)
  [ ] Implement delta hedging simulation (2 days)
  [ ] Re-run ALL backtests with realistic costs

Priority 1 (BEFORE SCALING):
  [ ] Add slippage modeling (2 hours)
  [ ] Validate costs against broker statements

DEPLOYMENT DECISION
-------------------
DO NOT DEPLOY:
  - Profile 3 (short straddle) - UNPROFITABLE after hedging
  - Profile 6 (vol-of-vol) - likely unprofitable
  - Profile 1 (long-dated gamma) - VERIFY after hedging simulation

CONSIDER DEPLOYMENT (after spread verification):
  - Profile 4 (vanna) - minimal cost impact
  - Profile 5 (skew) - minimal cost impact
  - Profile 2 (short-dated gamma) - moderate impact but may survive

THE BOTTOM LINE
---------------
You fixed the pricing bug (good work).

But your gamma strategies are missing $100-200/trade in hedging costs.

Profile 3 will almost certainly fail.
Profiles 1 & 6 are questionable.

Implement delta hedging simulation THIS WEEK or accept that 50% of
your strategies may be based on fantasy returns.

Real capital at risk. Get costs right BEFORE deployment.
