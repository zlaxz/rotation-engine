KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

DECISION ORDER ENFORCEMENT: ✅ CORRECT
  Risk (max loss) → TP2 (full exit) → TP1 (partial) → Condition → Time
  All 4 priority levels tested and verified.

TP1 TRACKING (NO DOUBLE-DIP): ✅ WORKING
  First TP1 hit triggers 50% exit.
  Second TP1 hit blocked (prevents double-counting).

LONG POSITIONS: ✅ CORRECT
  Entry cost positive.
  P&L calculations correct.
  All tests pass.

SHORT POSITIONS: ✅ CORRECT
  Entry cost negative (premium collected).
  P&L calculations correct for both winning and losing scenarios.
  All tests pass.

EDGE CASES: ✅ ALL HANDLED
  Unknown profile → graceful fallback
  Empty path → safe return
  Zero entry cost → handled with guard
  None values → safe defaults
