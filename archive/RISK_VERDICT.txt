ROTATION ENGINE - RISK VERDICT FOR $1M ACCOUNT DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

Date: 2025-11-15
Analysis: 604 trades across 6 profiles (2014-2025)
Account Size: $1,000,000

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE VERDICT
================================================================================

🔴 HIGH RISK - DO NOT DEPLOY $1M WITHOUT VALIDATION PHASE

Risk Score: 5/10 (where 5-6 = High Risk, 7+ = Critical Risk)
Status: NOT APPROVED for $1M capital deployment
Recommendation: Start with $10K-$50K validation phase

================================================================================
THE PAIN: MAXIMUM DRAWDOWN ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Individual Trade Level:
  • Worst intra-trade loss: -$5,498 (0.55% of $1M)
  • Median intra-trade loss: -$574 (0.06% of $1M)
  • Average intra-trade loss: -$814 (0.08% of $1M)

Portfolio Level:
  • Maximum portfolio drawdown: -$23,172 (2.3% of $1M)
  • Duration: 593 of 604 trades (98% of period)
  • Pattern: Clusters of losses with rare large wins

Family Impact at $1M:
  • Worst case loss: 2-3% of account (survivable)
  • Could recover in 2-4 months of trading
  • Not catastrophic, but emotionally difficult

Position Sizing Recommendation:
  • Conservative: $2,000 per trade
  • Moderate: $3,500 per trade
  • Aggressive: $5,000 per trade
  • Max concurrent positions: 10 (at 5% heat limit)

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM: CRITICAL FAILURE MODE
================================================================================

Current backtest shows:
  • Total trades: 604
  • Win rate: 45.9% (BELOW 50% threshold)
  • Total PnL: $1,030 (0.13% return)
  • Profit factor: 1.01x (CRITICALLY WEAK)

Problem #1: NEGATIVE EXPECTED VALUE
  Strategy returns: 0.13% (on paper)
  Execution costs: 0.3-0.5% (realistic)
  Expected outcome: NEGATIVE returns in live trading
  Risk: Strategy loses money from first trade onwards

Problem #2: WIN RATE UNSUSTAINABLE
  45.9% win rate means most trades lose
  Need 1.9x win/loss ratio to break even (current: 1.19x)
  Current structure: Winners barely cover losers, nothing for costs

Problem #3: PORTFOLIO DRAWDOWN CLUSTERING
  98% of backtest period spent in drawdown
  Suggests regime detection doesn't add value
  Or: regime switching too frequent, costs exceed benefit

Problem #4: PROFILE CONCENTRATION RISK
  Profile_3_CHARM: 3 of top 5 worst losses
  Profile_6_VOV: largest max DD (-$5,498)
  Profile_5_SKEW: only 26.7% win rate
  Profiles NOT independent = common failure mode

================================================================================
PROFILE-BY-PROFILE VERDICT
================================================================================

Profile_1_LDG (Long-Dated Gamma)
  Trades: 140 | Winners: 61 (43.6%) | Total PnL: -$2,863
  Status: NEGATIVE | Risk: Medium

Profile_2_SDG (Short-Dated Gamma)
  Trades: 42 | Winners: 15 (35.7%) | Total PnL: -$148
  Status: NEGATIVE | Risk: High (lowest win rate across profiles)

Profile_3_CHARM (Time Decay)
  Trades: 69 | Winners: 44 (63.8%) | Total PnL: -$1,051
  Status: NEGATIVE | Risk: CRITICAL (max DD -$5,361, worst loss -$3,490)

Profile_4_VANNA (Vol-Spot Correlation)
  Trades: 151 | Winners: 88 (58.3%) | Total PnL: +$13,507
  Status: ONLY PROFITABLE PROFILE | Risk: Low-Medium (this one works!)

Profile_5_SKEW (Skew)
  Trades: 30 | Winners: 8 (26.7%) | Total PnL: -$3,337
  Status: WORST | Risk: CRITICAL (26.7% win rate, -$111 avg loss)

Profile_6_VOV (Vol-of-Vol)
  Trades: 172 | Winners: 61 (35.5%) | Total PnL: -$5,077
  Status: NEGATIVE | Risk: High (large max DD, but recovers sometimes)

KEY FINDING: Only Profile_4_VANNA is profitable!
  All other 5 profiles are underwater
  Portfolio only survives because VANNA carries the others
  Concentration risk: Strategy depends on single profile

================================================================================
RISK SCORE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

Factor 1: Win Rate (45.9% vs 50% target)
  ❌ FAIL: Below 50% means most trades lose
  Penalty: +2 points

Factor 2: Profit Factor (1.01x vs 1.5x minimum)
  ❌ FAIL: Barely covers losers, no margin for costs
  Penalty: +2 points

Factor 3: Sharpe Ratio (0.005)
  ❌ FAIL: Essentially zero risk-adjusted returns
  Penalty: +1 point (rolled into profit factor)

Factor 4: Max Intra-Trade DD ($5,498 = 0.55% of account)
  ✅ PASS: Individual trades well-contained
  Penalty: 0 points

Factor 5: Portfolio DD ($23,172 = 2.3%)
  ✅ PASS: Portfolio-level losses manageable
  Penalty: 0 points

Factor 6: Consecutive Losses (20 trades)
  ⚠️ CONCERN: 20 losing streak possible
  Penalty: +1 point

TOTAL: 5/10 (HIGH RISK)

================================================================================
CAN FAMILY AFFORD THIS?
================================================================================

Technical Answer: YES
  Maximum loss at position size $3,500: -$5,498 (0.55% of $1M)
  Family has adequate capital buffer
  Single trade loss is manageable

Practical Answer: MAYBE
  Strategy doesn't beat transaction costs in backtest
  Live execution will be worse than model
  Winning trades need to overcome realistic slippage
  May hit 20-losing-trade streaks (happens in backtest)

Honest Answer: NOT YET
  Backtest shows unprofitable edge
  Needs validation on real money first
  Too many red flags for direct $1M deployment
  Better to prove concept on smaller account

================================================================================
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE $1M DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

Phase 1: Execution Validation (3 months, $10K-$50K)
  □ Run 50-100 trades on real capital
  □ Measure actual execution prices vs model
  □ Calculate realistic transaction costs
  □ Validate win rate holds up (need >50% to proceed)
  □ Check for regime drift (2024-2025 markets different)
  ✓ GATE: If Phase 1 achieves >50% win rate AND positive PnL, proceed

Phase 2: Statistical Proof (6 months, $50K-$250K)
  □ Run 200+ trades to validate statistical significance
  □ Perform out-of-sample testing on held-back data
  □ Run walk-forward validation for regime detection
  □ Bootstrap analysis for robustness
  □ Stress test under different market regimes
  ✓ GATE: If Phase 2 shows >0.3% daily returns, proceed

Phase 3: Profile Validation
  □ Identify why only VANNA is profitable
  □ Fix or eliminate CHARM, SKEW, SDG, VOV profiles
  □ Or: rebalance profile weights
  □ Goal: Get all 6 profiles profitable before scaling

Phase 4: Full Deployment (only if Phase 1, 2, 3 pass)
  □ Ramp from $250K to $500K to $1M
  □ Monitor Greeks management at scale
  □ Track real P&L vs model
  □ Maintain discipline on position sizing

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION: IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

DO NOT trade this strategy on $1M immediately.

Instead:

1. UNDERSTAND THE VANNA ANOMALY
   Profile_4_VANNA is only profitable profile (+$13,507)
   All others are negative
   Question: Why? Is it real edge or luck?
   Action: Deep-dive profile_4_vanna backtest code
   Timeline: 1 week

2. FIX TRANSACTION COST MODELING
   Current backtest: 0.13% return
   Realistic execution: 0.3-0.5% costs
   Strategy is mathematically unprofitable
   Action: Model realistic bid-ask, commissions, slippage
   Timeline: 1 week

3. IMPROVE WIN RATE TO >55%
   Current: 45.9% (unviable)
   Target: 55%+ (breakeven territory after costs)
   Action: Review entry/exit logic, tighten regime classification
   Timeline: 2-4 weeks

4. VALIDATION TRADING ON $25K
   Once win rate improves to 55%+
   Run 100 real trades with real money
   Measure actual execution costs
   Confirm Sharpe >0.2 before considering larger capital
   Timeline: 3-6 months

5. DECISION POINT: $1M DEPLOYMENT
   Only after all above completed AND validated
   No exceptions, no shortcuts
   Timeline: 6-12 months from now

================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

Strategy Profile: EARLY STAGE, HIGH POTENTIAL, HIGH RISK

Current State:
  ✅ Shows positive total PnL on paper
  ✅ Individual trade losses manageable
  ✅ One profile (VANNA) shows real promise
  ❌ Loses money to execution costs
  ❌ Win rate too low for viability
  ❌ Not validated out-of-sample
  ❌ Multiple red flags on robustness

Risk Rating: 5/10 (HIGH RISK)

Deployment Verdict: NOT APPROVED
  Current fitness for $1M: 30%
  Target fitness for $1M: 80%+

Recommendation:
  1. Fix win rate and execution cost issues
  2. Validate on $25K for 100+ trades
  3. Improve Sharpe from 0.005 to 0.20+
  4. Then and only then consider $1M

Timeline to $1M: 6-12 months minimum
