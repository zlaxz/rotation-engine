PROFILE 1 LDG - QUICK REFERENCE SUMMARY
================================================================================

DATA: 140 trades from backtest_results/current/results.json

PEAK MAGNITUDE STATISTICS:
  Mean peak:             $311.28
  Median peak:           $198.30
  Std dev:               $346.38
  Range:                 -$17.20 to $2,267.80

  Distribution:
    - Large peaks (>$500):     31 trades (22.1%)
    - Medium ($200-$500):      39 trades (27.9%)
    - Small (<$200):           70 trades (50.0%)
    - Negative:                23 trades (16.4%)

================================================================================
WHAT PREDICTS LARGE PEAKS (>$500)?
================================================================================

1. PATH VOLATILITY (Correlation: +0.7101, p<0.001) ***CRITICAL***
   Large peaks:  $309.71 avg path vol
   Small peaks:  $118.25 avg path vol
   → 161% MORE volatility needed for large peaks

2. DAYS TO PEAK (Correlation: +0.5334, p<0.001) ***CRITICAL***
   Large peaks:  10.1 days average
   Small peaks:   4.2 days average
   → Positions need TIME to develop

3. ENTRY MOMENTUM (Return_5d: -0.1925, p=0.023) *SIGNIFICANT*
   Best after negative return (recent pullback)
   Worst after very strong momentum
   → Straddles work after downturns (mean reversion)

4. IV LEVEL (Vega: -0.0377, p=0.659) NOT PREDICTIVE
   Large peaks avg vega: $154.21
   Small peaks avg vega: $163.40
   → Entry IV level doesn't matter

5. SLOPE (Slope: +0.0740, p=0.385) NOT PREDICTIVE
   All 140 trades have positive slope
   → Regime filter only (uptrend only)

================================================================================
THE CRITICAL PROBLEM: EXIT FAILURE
================================================================================

WHY STRATEGY LOSES MONEY (-$2,863 net despite 83.6% positive peaks):

Peak capture ratio (final P&L / peak P&L):
  Mean:      -380.59% (extreme outliers from reversals)
  Median:     0% (50% end at breakeven or worse)
  Success:    38/140 trades (27.1%) capture >50% of peak

Maximum drawdown after peak:
  Mean:      -$500.22
  Median:    -$386.00
  Worst:     -$2,734.00

EXAMPLE: Entry at -$500, peaks at +$600, exits at -$100
  → Captured peak but held too long

ROOT CAUSE: Positions stay open after peak day (day 7), experiencing:
  1. Theta decay accelerates (gamma becomes disadvantageous)
  2. IV crush (vega loss dominates gamma gains)
  3. Random walk reversion (back toward ATM, losing money)

================================================================================
EXIT STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

OBSERVATION: Peaks occur ~6.9 days after entry (median day 7)

RECOMMENDATION 1: TIME-BASED EXIT (SIMPLEST)
  - Exit at day 7 (when peaks occur)
  - Expected capture: Full $311.28 average
  - Implementation: Hard rule on calendar days

RECOMMENDATION 2: PEAK-SEEKING WITH PULLBACK
  - Track rolling max P&L daily
  - Exit on 3-day pullback from peak
  - Advantage: Adaptive to volatility regime

RECOMMENDATION 3: P&L THRESHOLD EXIT
  - Exit if peak-to-current exceeds $50 loss
  - Forces capture before major reversals

RECOMMENDATION 4: VOLATILITY-BASED EXIT
  - Exit when daily volatility drops (peak event complete)
  - Exit when path vol drops below threshold
  - Most aligned with convexity thesis

================================================================================
ENTRY CONDITIONS: LARGE vs SMALL PEAKS
================================================================================

GREEK COMPARISON (Entry):
  Delta:      0.1291 vs 0.1315 (identical)
  Gamma:      0.0288 vs 0.0285 (identical)
  Theta:     -$53.01 vs -$55.56 (identical)
  Vega:      $154.21 vs $163.40 (5.6% difference, not significant)

MARKET CONDITION COMPARISON (Entry):
  DTE:        79.1 vs 76.8 (not different)
  RV20:       0.1446 vs 0.1474 (not different)
  Slope:      0.0484 vs 0.0432 (not different)
  Return_5d:  0.0070 vs 0.0138 (not different)

CONCLUSION: Entry conditions are NEARLY IDENTICAL for large vs small peaks
  → Outcome is DETERMINED BY SUBSEQUENT MARKET BEHAVIOR, NOT ENTRY SELECTION
  → Problem is NOT entry refinement—it's EXIT timing

================================================================================
BY THE NUMBERS: TIMING MATTERS
================================================================================

Early peaks (≤3 days):
  - Count: 46 trades
  - Avg peak: $71.69
  - % reaching >$500: 4.3%
  - Interpretation: Mostly noise/random moves, should exit quickly

Late peaks (>10 days):
  - Count: 43 trades
  - Avg peak: $508.47
  - % reaching >$500: 37.2%
  - Interpretation: Confirmed moves, time to develop convexity

IMPLICATION: If exit at day 3, you miss the real moves. If exit at day 10,
you capture most peaks but also capture drawdowns from reversal.
→ Day 7 (median) is the sweet spot

================================================================================
QUICK DIAGNOSTICS CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Q: Are entries identifying convexity correctly?
A: YES. 83.6% of trades reach positive peaks. Entry logic works.

Q: Are peaks large enough to profit?
A: SOMETIMES. Mean $311, but 50% peak below $200. Depends on volatility.

Q: Is entry selection the problem?
A: NO. Entry conditions are identical for large vs small peaks.

Q: Is exit timing the problem?
A: YES. 73% of trades fail to capture 50% of peak. This is THE problem.

Q: Can we fix this quickly?
A: YES. Time-based exit at day 7 would be massive improvement.

Q: Should we refine entry conditions?
A: NO. Entry is working. Focus on exit.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS (Recommended Order)
================================================================================

1. IMPLEMENT DAY-7 FIXED EXIT
   - Replace current exit logic
   - Measure impact on backtest results
   - Expected: -$2,863 → ~$3,000+ (rough estimate)

2. A/B TEST EXIT STRATEGIES
   - Compare: Fixed day-7 vs Peak-seeking vs Volatility-based
   - Measure: Capture ratio, win rate, risk metrics

3. VALIDATE ACROSS REGIMES
   - Does exit timing differ in high-vol vs low-vol markets?
   - Should different exits apply to different regimes?

4. IMPLEMENT IN LIVE TRADING
   - Start with smallest position size
   - Monitor capture ratios vs backtest
   - Refine based on actual execution
