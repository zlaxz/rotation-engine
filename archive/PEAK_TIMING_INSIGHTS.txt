PROFILE 1 (LDG): PEAK TIMING ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================================================

DATASET: 140 trades analyzed
- Profitable: 117 (83.6%)
- Unprofitable: 23 (16.4%)

KEY STATISTICS
==============
Mean peak day:       6.91 (Day 7)
Median peak day:     7.00
Std deviation:       5.00
Range:               0-14 days

CRITICAL DISCOVERIES
====================

1. PROFITABILITY TIMING (Very Fast Recovery)
   - 45.3% of trades turn profitable on DAY 1
   - 59% profitable by DAY 2
   - 76% profitable by DAY 3
   - Average time to profitability: 3.1 days
   → Most trades recover from theta decay within 2 days

2. PEAK TIMING (Much Slower Distribution)
   - Mean: Day 6.9
   - Median: Day 7.0
   - Bimodal pattern detected:
     * Cluster 1: Days 1-5 (30% of trades, median peak $130)
     * Dead zone: Days 6-11 (only 30% of trades)
     * Cluster 2: Days 12-14 (23% of trades, median peak $438)
   → 35% larger gains in late cluster, but requires 2x+ holding time

3. PROFIT REALIZATION SCHEDULE
   Day 1: $52.80 median
   Day 2: $84.80 median (+61% from Day 1)
   Day 5: $124.30 median (+47% from Day 2)
   Day 7: $140.80 median (only +13% from Day 5)
   Day 9: $173.80 median (plateau zone)
   → Profits cluster in first 3-5 days, then flatten

4. DECAY RISK AFTER PEAK (Brutal)
   +1 day:  -66.5% median loss from peak
   +2 days: -87.5% median loss
   +3 days: -125.6% median loss
   +5 days: -154.5% median loss
   → Holding past peak = rapid capital evaporation

5. CAPTURE MILESTONES
   25% of peaks caught by Day 2
   50% of peaks caught by Day 7
   75% of peaks caught by Day 12
   90% of peaks caught by Day 14
   → To get 50% of peaks requires 7-day hold (risky for gamma)

EXIT STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION
=============================

THREE-TIER APPROACH:

Tier 1: Day 3 Harvest (Recommended Primary)
- Trigger: Exit any trade +30% or higher
- Captures: 36% of all trades near peak
- Execution: Quick gamma snaps with minimal theta bleed
- Median profit: $73
- Frequency: ~50 trades/140 = high turnover

Tier 2: Day 7 Window (Secondary Holds)
- Trigger: Re-evaluate Greeks, vol regime, trend
- Captures: Additional 30% of trades
- Execution: Hold early-entry losers for recovery opportunity
- Median profit by Day 7: $141
- Decision point: Is vol regime supporting extension to Day 10-14?

Tier 3: Hard Stop at Day 14
- Trigger: Force exit all remaining positions
- Reason: Theta decay accelerates post-Day 9 (bleed = losses)
- Prevents: Extended duration risk, pin risk, assignment

BUSINESS LOGIC
==============

Why this works for LDG:
1. Most (59%) turnable profitable by Day 2 → take the wins
2. 30-35% bimodal split → acknowledge two populations
3. Peak distribution means 50% need >7 days → too long for gamma
4. Decay post-peak is exponential → exit urgency is real
5. High-frequency approach = compound edge (more rotations)

ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FOR CODE
=============================

Entry Rules (Already Done)
- Detect regime + profile match
- Execute straddle/strangle structure
- Mark entry Greeks and vol level

Exit Rules (Implement This):
1. Track daily P&L from entry
2. Day 1-3:
   - If profit > 30% of max risk: EXIT (Tier 1)
   - Else: hold for day 3
3. Day 3-7:
   - Evaluate vol regime: expanding vs. compressing?
   - If contracting + no vol catalysts: EXIT (Tier 2)
   - If strong vol: hold to Day 7 checkpoint
4. Day 7-14:
   - Hard decline in profitability observed after Day 9
   - Force exit all by Day 14 (no exceptions)

RISK MANAGEMENT
===============

Position Sizing:
- Assume 30% of positions exit Days 1-3 (quick wins)
- Assume 40% exit Days 4-7 (secondary recovery)
- Assume 30% hit Day 14 limit (force close)

Daily Loss Limits:
- Individual trade: Hard exit if loss > 50% of max risk
- Portfolio: Theta bleed accelerates after Day 9, monitor daily

Expected Outcomes (Based on 140 trades):
- ~42 trades peak Days 1-5 (median $130) → Exit $100 average
- ~26 trades peak Days 6-9 (median $289) → Exit $240 average
- ~49 trades peak Days 10-14 (median $438) → Exit $300 average
- ~23 never profitable (median -$17) → Exit $0 (loss)

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Backtest exit timing impact (compare 3-day vs 7-day vs 14-day)
2. Analyze regime dependency (vol expanding vs. compressing impact)
3. Implement dynamic exit based on Greeks delta/theta ratio
4. Monitor: Do late-cluster trades (Days 10-14) require specific entry filters?
5. Optimize: Can entry regime selection reduce the 16.4% unprofitable rate?
