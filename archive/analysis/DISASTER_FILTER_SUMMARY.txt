================================================================================
WHAT THESE CONDITIONS MEAN
================================================================================

HIGH RV5 (> 0.22):
  Interpretation: Market is whipsawing wildly
  Why it's bad: Greeks are unstable, gamma bleed accelerates, straddles bleed
  Profile impact: Worst for CHARM (short decay), good for LDG (long gamma)
  Frequency: 17.5% of all trades

FLAT/NEGATIVE SLOPE (< 0.005):
  Interpretation: No directional trend, mean-reversion environment
  Why it's bad: Trend-following Greeks don't work, convexity edges disappear
  Profile impact: Worst for VANNA, SKEW (direction-dependent)
  Frequency: 31.3% of all trades

NEGATIVE MOMENTUM (return_10d < 0):
  Interpretation: Sellers are in control, reversal risk high
  Why it's bad: Strategies positioned for continuation get whipsawed
  Profile impact: Worst for positions betting on continuation
  Frequency: 33.1% of all trades

COMBINATION (RV5 > 0.22 + slope < 0.005):
  Interpretation: Maximum chaos with no direction
  Why it's bad: Can't hedge with trend, can't harvest vol without direction
  Profile impact: Universally bad across all profiles
  Frequency: 10.2% of all trades

================================================================================
PROFILE VULNERABILITY
================================================================================

Worst performing in disasters:
  1. CHARM/Decay (9 worst losers, avg -$1,692 loss)
  2. LDG (2 losers but -$1,549 avg, limited sample)
  3. SDG (8 losers, -$1,167 avg)

Most resilient:
  4. VANNA/VOV (43 combined, but lower average losses)
  5. SKEW (4 losers, limited sample)

Note: VANNA/VOV show high frequency in worst losers but moderate severity,
suggesting they're more robust to volatility spikes but still vulnerable
to momentum reversals.

================================================================================
FILTERING IMPACT
================================================================================

BASELINE (No filter):
  Trades: 668
  Total P&L: -$22,877.60
  Win rate: 44.2%
  Per-trade avg: -$34.25

AFTER RV5 FILTER (RV5 > 0.22):
  Trades: 551 (-17.5%)
  Total P&L: +$898.80 ✅ BREAKEVEN
  Win rate: 46.1%
  P&L improvement: +$23,776.40 (+103.9%)
  Impact per skipped trade: $210.90 (saved loss)

AFTER DUAL FILTER (RV5 > 0.22 AND slope < 0.005):
  Trades: 600 (-10.2%)
  Total P&L: -$10,743.00
  Win rate: 45.0%
  P&L improvement: +$12,134.60 (+53.0%)
  Impact per skipped trade: $178.45 (saved loss)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION TIER 1 (Immediate):
  Add RV5 filter
  Condition: If RV5 > 0.22, SKIP TRADE
  Expected improvement: +$23.8K (103% gain)
  Trade reduction: 17.5%
  Simplicity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (one number to check)

IMPLEMENTATION TIER 2 (Optional, for balance):
  Add dual filter
  Condition: If (RV5 > 0.22 AND slope < 0.005), SKIP TRADE
  Expected improvement: +$12.1K (52% gain from baseline)
  Trade reduction: 10.2% (from 668 to 600)
  Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐ (two numbers to check)

DO NOT use both together (RV5 filter already includes most dual filter cases)

================================================================================
SPECIFIC TRADES THAT WOULD BE FILTERED
================================================================================

Top filtered disaster (RV5+slope):
  2025-04-25: Profile_3_CHARM, Loss -$1,682 (RV5=0.309, slope=-0.0096)
  2022-10-04: Profile_2_SDG, Loss -$1,496 (RV5=0.353, slope=-0.034)
  2022-06-24: Profile_2_SDG & VOV, Loss -$1,357 (RV5=0.269, slope=-0.018)

Worst unfiltered disasters (RV5 < 0.22):
  2025-02-20: Profile_3_CHARM, Loss -$3,490 (RV5=0.085, slope=0.001)
  2022-05-27: Profile_3_CHARM, Loss -$3,162 (RV5=0.181, slope=0.008)
  2021-02-16: Profile_1_LDG, Loss -$2,293 (RV5=0.074, slope=0.045)

Note: The absolute worst trades have low RV5 but extreme decay scenarios
(CHARM strategy short straddles during volatility crush). These require
different filters (profile-specific or time-decay monitoring).

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Immediate:
  1. Add RV5 to backtest engine entry_conditions
  2. Implement RV5 > 0.22 filter gate
  3. Re-run full backtest 2020-2025
  4. Compare metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, max drawdown

Investigation:
  5. Study the 15.2% of winners with high RV5 - what made them work?
  6. Analyze Profile_3_CHARM worst losses - are they preventable?
  7. Check if dual filter (RV5 + slope) improves risk metrics further

Advanced:
  8. Can we refine RV5 threshold (0.22 optimal or too strict/loose)?
  9. Do regime classifications correlate with RV5 failures?
  10. Can we predict when high-RV trades will win vs lose?
