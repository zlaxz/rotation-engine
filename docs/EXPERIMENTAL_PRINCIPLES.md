# Experimental Principles - Rotation Engine

**This is a research lab, not a risk committee.**

## Core Philosophy

**Markets are a physics experiment.** There are exploitable laws. Our job is to discover them, test them, and capture the edge before it disappears.

## The Mindset

### Quick & Nimble (NOT Institutional)

**We are:**
- ✅ Small capital ($1M) - our advantage
- ✅ Fast moving - can exploit niches institutions can't
- ✅ Experimental - test everything, kill failures, amplify successes
- ✅ Edge hunters - discovering NEW opportunities, not validating old wisdom

**We are NOT:**
- ❌ Conservative institutional quant
- ❌ Risk-averse portfolio managers
- ❌ Trying to replicate what big firms do

### Small Capital IS The Advantage

**What institutions can't do:**
- Rotate positions 50-100x per year (too expensive at scale)
- Enter/exit small option positions efficiently (liquidity constraints)
- Move capital in hours instead of days
- Experiment with novel signals (compliance, bureaucracy)

**What we CAN do:**
- High-frequency convexity rotation
- Rapid regime detection with LLM analysis
- Exploit transient mispricings that vanish in 4-12 hours
- Test 100 hypotheses, keep the 5 that work

## The Thesis

### LLM Speed Advantage

**Traditional quant:**
- Pre-programmed rules (if VIX > X and skew > Y...)
- Lag time: 1-2 days to detect regime shift
- Rigid, can't adapt to new patterns

**LLM-powered approach:**
- Analyze vol surface + flows + skew + order book in real-time
- Natural language reasoning about complex interactions
- Detection lag: 1-4 hours
- Adaptive to new market structures

**If LLM detects regime 2-12 hours faster:**
- Enter mispriced convexity while still cheap
- Exit before crowd arrives
- Edge window: hours, not days

### High Frequency IS The Strategy

**Target:** 0.5-1% per rotation
**Frequency:** 50-100 rotations per year
**Annual:** 25-100% (conservative) to 180-365% (aggressive target)

**Even "only" 75% annual is world-class.**

### Transaction Costs Are Constraints, Not Blockers

**We measure them precisely:**
- Bid-ask spreads on SPY/SPX options
- Slippage on actual fills
- Delta hedging frequency costs
- Commissions

**Then we optimize:**
- Which profiles have acceptable cost/edge ratios?
- What rotation frequency maximizes net profit?
- When is edge > cost? (Trade) vs edge < cost? (Wait)

**We don't reject strategies because "transaction costs might be high."**
**We test and MEASURE.**

## Operating Principles

### 1. Test Everything

**Hypothesis → Test → Measure → Decide**

Not: "This probably won't work because..."
Instead: "Let's test if this works. Here's the data."

### 2. Kill What Fails, Amplify What Works

**No emotional attachment to ideas.**

- If 2-regime system shows no edge → kill it, test something else
- If long-dated gamma underperforms → remove it from portfolio
- If short-dated gamma crushes it → allocate more capital

**Data decides, not theory.**

### 3. Speed Over Perfection

**Build → Test → Learn → Iterate**

- Don't spend 6 months building perfect system
- Build simple version in 1 week, test in 1 week, learn in 1 week
- Iterate 10 times faster than institutional quant teams

### 4. Measure Everything

**What gets measured gets optimized:**
- Every rotation: entry price, exit price, P&L, transaction costs
- Every regime detection: time to detect, accuracy, false positives
- Every profile: win rate, avg profit, Sharpe, max drawdown

**Trust data, not intuition.**

### 5. Small Bets, Big Learning

**Don't need to risk $1M to learn:**
- Paper trade first (test execution quality)
- Go live with $10k-50k (validate in production)
- Scale only after 3-6 months of validated edge

**Learning is cheap. Losing capital without learning is expensive.**

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Regime Detection Speed Test
**Goal:** Prove LLM detects regimes 2-12 hours faster than traditional signals
**Success:** Detection lag advantage exists and is measurable
**Failure:** LLM is no faster than rules-based classifier

### Phase 2: Single Rotation Edge Test
**Goal:** Prove convexity rotation captures edge after transaction costs
**Success:** Expected value per rotation > 0.3% after all costs
**Failure:** Edge < transaction costs

### Phase 3: High-Frequency Validation
**Goal:** Prove edge persists at 50-100 rotations/year
**Success:** Annual Sharpe > 1.5 in walk-forward test
**Failure:** Edge degrades with frequency or overfits

### Phase 4: Live Trading Validation
**Goal:** Prove paper trading results hold in production
**Success:** Live performance matches backtest within 20%
**Failure:** Execution quality destroys backtested edge

## What "World-Class" Means

**Annual Return Benchmarks:**
- 15-25%: Good retail trader
- 30-50%: Excellent retail trader
- 60-100%: Elite trader / small hedge fund
- 100%+: Exceptional (Renaissance Medallion territory)

**Even if we "only" achieve 60-75% annual, that's:**
- $600k-750k profit on $1M
- Top 0.1% of all traders
- Sustainable income for family
- Proof of concept for scaling

**We're not being reckless. We're being ambitious with rigorous testing.**

## The Experiment

**We treat this like physics research:**
1. Hypothesis: Regime detection + convexity rotation = exploitable edge
2. Experiment: Build system, test on historical data, validate live
3. Measurement: Precise tracking of all metrics
4. Analysis: Does edge exist? How large? How stable?
5. Conclusion: Scale if validated, pivot if not

**This is science, not speculation.**
