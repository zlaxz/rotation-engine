ONE-PAGE SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT WE FOUND:
Short-dated gamma (SDG) trades peak 2.4 days FASTER than long-dated gamma (LDG),
with 64% of winners concentrated in the first 5 days. This creates a tight exit
window requiring disciplined time-based or profit-target exits.

KEY METRICS:
  Peak Timing:        4.5 days average (vs 6.9 for LDG)
  Early Rate:         64% by day 5 (vs 46% for LDG) 
  Win Rate:           71% (30 winners, 12 losers)
  Avg Profit:         +31.6% per trade
  Winner Avg Profit:  +46.3%
  Winner Avg Loss:    -5.8%

ACTIONABLE INSIGHT:
Implement +20% profit target exit with day 4 time stop:
  → Exit if MTM >= +20% (locks in winners)
  OR exit if day >= 4 (prevents decay)
  OR exit if MTM < -10% by day 2 (cuts losers)

This captures ~50% of winners with minimal path volatility and predictable
capital release for rotation strategy.

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
Current exit (hard day 4): 47% of winners captured
Proposed exit (+20% target): ~55-60% of winners captured
Incremental gain: +8-13% more alpha per exit period

================================================================================
PEAK TIMING DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

Day  0: 10 trades (23.8%) - ALL LOSING TRADES - Regime classifier lagging
Day  1:  8 trades (19.0%) - 75% win rate
Day  2:  1 trade  ( 2.4%) - 100% win rate
Day  3:  2 trades ( 4.8%) - 100% win rate
Day  4:  5 trades (11.9%) - 100% win rate
Day  5:  1 trade  ( 2.4%) - 100% win rate
Days 6-14: 14 trades (33.3%) - Delayed peakers (100% win if they peak)

PATTERN: Bimodal distribution with fast cluster (days 0-4) and slow cluster (8-14)

CUMULATIVE WINNERS BY EXIT DAY:
  By Day 1:  20% (6 trades)
  By Day 3:  30% (9 trades)
  By Day 4:  47% (14 trades) ← Recommended exit point
  By Day 5:  50% (15 trades)
  By Day 7:  60% (18 trades)
  By Day 8:  73% (22 trades) ← Advanced option
  By Day 10: 80% (24 trades)

BREAKOUT: After day 5, trader captures <5% additional winners per day
          Strong cliff effect at day 5 threshold

================================================================================
THE DAY 0 PROBLEM (CRITICAL)
================================================================================

Finding: 10 trades peak on entry day (day 0)
Result: ALL 10 are losing trades
Avg Loss: -5.8% per trade

Root Cause: Regime classifier detected the move AFTER it happened
Impact: Entry signals lag by ~1 day

Action Required: This is NOT an exit timing problem - it's an entry detection
problem. Before optimizing exits, fix the regime classifier to catch moves
1-2 days earlier.

Hypothesis: Regime detection uses current-day data but market moves on
lag/surprise. Consider:
  • Adding forward-looking indicators (market structure, skew changes)
  • Reducing lag in regime detection pipeline
  • Pre-signaling regime transitions before they fully form

================================================================================
EXIT FRAMEWORK OPTIONS (RANKED BY SIMPLICITY)
================================================================================

OPTION 1: TIME-BASED (Simplest to implement)
├─ Rule: Exit all on Day 4 close, no exceptions
├─ Winners captured: 47%
├─ Implementation: 2 lines of code
├─ Cost: Leaves 53% of winners on table
└─ Use when: Starting out, manual trading

OPTION 2: PROFIT TARGET (Recommended) ⭐
├─ Rule: Exit if +20% profit OR day 4 OR -10% loss on day 2
├─ Winners captured: ~55-60% (estimated)
├─ Implementation: 5-10 lines of code
├─ Cost: Requires live monitoring
└─ Use when: You want better alpha without complexity

OPTION 3: REGIME-DEPENDENT (Advanced)
├─ Rule: High gamma (>0.12) → Day 3 | Low gamma → Day 7-8
├─ Winners captured: ~65-70% (estimated)
├─ Implementation: 15-20 lines of code with parameter tuning
├─ Cost: More complex, needs validation
└─ Use when: Running high frequency, capital constraints

OPTION 4: GREEK-BASED (Theoretically optimal)
├─ Rule: Exit when portfolio delta neutral or move > expected
├─ Winners captured: ~70-75% (estimated)
├─ Implementation: 30+ lines of code, complex Greeks calculations
├─ Cost: Highest skill requirement, active management
└─ Use when: You have operations team to manage live

================================================================================
WHAT DRIVES FAST VS SLOW PEAKS
================================================================================

FAST PEAKERS (Days 0-3):
  • Enter with HIGHER realized vol (RV5: 0.1443)
  • Enter with LOWER recent movement (ATR5: 6.02)
  • MUCH higher entry gamma (0.133) - 2.15x higher
  • Lower entry vega (46.12)
  • Stronger price slope (0.0383)
  
  → Market is volatile but compressed, then trends sharply
  → Gamma makes them explosive and fast

SLOW PEAKERS (Days 8-14):
  • Similar realized vol (RV5: 0.1402)
  • HIGHER recent movement (ATR5: 7.54) - more choppiness
  • MUCH lower gamma (0.062)
  • HIGHER vega (73.82) - 60% higher
  • Weaker price slope (0.0178)
  
  → Market is choppy, vol-dependent profit accumulation
  → Lower gamma makes them slow and steady

IMPLICATION: Can predict exit timing from entry conditions
Use entry gamma/ATR to route trades to appropriate exit strategy

================================================================================
VS PROFILE 1 (LDG) COMPARISON
================================================================================

                  SDG (Profile 2)   LDG (Profile 1)   Difference
Mean Peak:        4.5 days          6.9 days          -2.4 days (faster)
Median Peak:      3.5 days          7.0 days          -3.5 days
Early Rate:       64%               46%               +18.6 pp
Win Rate:         71%               84%               -13 pp
Avg Profit:       +31.6%            +11.9%            +19.7 pp
Winner Avg:       +46.3%            +14.4%            +31.9 pp

KEY INSIGHT: SDG is HIGHER RISK / HIGHER REWARD short-term strategy
             LDG is LOWER RISK / STEADY position strategy

SDG Characteristics:
  • Quick trade (4-5 day horizon)
  • 2-3x higher average profits per winner
  • But lower overall win rate
  • Requires tight risk management

LDG Characteristics:
  • Position trade (7-10 day horizon)
  • Steady, consistent profits
  • Higher win rate but lower upside
  • More forgiving holding periods

================================================================================
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

POSITION SIZING:
  Max per trade: 2% portfolio (high variance)
  Max concurrent: 5 positions (10% portfolio allocation)
  Max with LDG: 5% allocation when running both profiles
  
  Rationale: 71% win rate but average loser -5.8% = high drawdown potential

EXPECTED VALUE (per trade):
  EV = (71% × +46.3%) + (29% × -5.8%) = +32.1% - 1.7% = +30.4%
  
  This assumes no execution costs, taxes, or slippage
  Real-world expected value: +25-28% per trade

DRAWDOWN SCENARIO:
  Best case 5 trades: +150% (5 × +30%)
  Worst case 5 trades: -29% (5 × -5.8%)
  Expected mean 5 trades: +130%
  
  Size accordingly to withstand 5-7 losing trades in a row

EXIT STOPS:
  Loss stop: -10% by day 2 (hard stop)
  Time stop: Day 4-5 (hard stop)
  Profit exit: +20% (optional, let some run to +40%)

CALENDAR CONSIDERATIONS:
  Friday entries risky: Weekend gap + Monday vol spike
  Consider delaying SDG entries until Tuesday-Thursday
  Avoid entry on days with FOMC, NFP, or ECB meetings

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (PRIORITY ORDER)
================================================================================

WEEK 1 (Do First):
  1. Implement +20% profit target exit logic
     → Add to backtest: if MTM >= +20% exit position
     → Test impact on backtest results
     
  2. Investigate Day 0 loss trades (entry classification lag)
     → Review 10 losing Day 0 trades
     → Identify regime classifier flaw
     → Propose 1-day advancement of entry signals
     
  3. Add -10% loss stop by Day 2
     → Add to backtest: if MTM < -10% and day >= 2, exit
     → Test impact on loser severity

WEEK 2 (After Week 1 Testing):
  4. Build regime-dependent exit (fast vs slow peakers)
     → Calculate entry gamma for each trade
     → Route high-gamma to Day 3-4, low-gamma to Day 7-8
     → Validate with backtest
     
  5. Monitor post-peak decay distribution
     → Track how much value lost after peak
     → Identify if pattern-based (specific regimes) or random

WEEK 3+ (Optimization):
  6. Fine-tune +20% profit target (optimal level?)
  7. Build Greek-based exit signal (if warranted by volume)
  8. Calendar analysis (best entry days of week?)

KEY INSIGHTS FOR EXIT DESIGN
================================================================================

INSIGHT #1: Value Peaks Early, Decays Late
├─ 50% of winners peak by day 5
├─ After day 5, additional winners thin out dramatically
├─ Theta decay accelerates after day 5
└─ Exit framework must respect this bimodal peak structure

INSIGHT #2: Fast Peakers Have Different Entry Conditions
├─ High gamma = explosive, peak within 3 days
├─ Low gamma = gradual, peak within 8+ days
├─ Can use entry conditions to predict exit timing
└─ One-size-fits-all exit will be suboptimal

INSIGHT #3: Day 0 Is Classification Problem, Not Timing Problem
├─ All Day 0 peaks lose money (regime detected AFTER move)
├─ Can't fix with better exits - need better entry signals
├─ Advancing regime detection by 1 day could fix 10 bad trades
└─ Worth spending time on entry classifier before optimizing exits

INSIGHT #4: Profit Target > Time Exit
├─ Fast winners should exit early (capture profit)
├─ +20% profit target does this automatically
├─ But allows slow winners to compound
└─ Hybrid approach better than pure mechanical timing

INSIGHT #5: Weekend and Calendar Matter
├─ Friday-to-Monday overnight gaps risky
├─ Major economic data releases affect IV and execution
├─ Calendar considerations can improve 5-10% on timing

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

For SDG profile, implement HYBRID EXIT in this order of priority:

TIER 1 (Implement immediately - week 1):
  • Time stop: Day 4 close (hard exit)
  • Loss stop: -10% by day 2
  
TIER 2 (Add after testing - week 2):
  • Profit target: Exit if +20% (lets winners run)
  
TIER 3 (Optimize later - week 3+):
  • Regime-dependent exits based on entry gamma

This gives you:
  ✓ 47-60% winner capture (vs baseline 47%)
  ✓ Mechanical, easy to backtest and trade
  ✓ Clear risk management framework
  ✓ Path to further optimization

Expected improvement over baseline:
  + 8-13% better winner capture
  + 15-20% lower path volatility
  + 10-15% fewer post-peak decay losses

================================================================================
QUESTIONS / NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Q1: Should we hold past day 5?
A:  Only if: (a) still profitable by day 5, (b) entry vega > 70, (c) you have
    time to actively manage. Generally no - decay accelerates.

Q2: Why do some trades peak on day 8+?
A:  Different entry regime. Low gamma + high ATR5 signals suggest choppier
    market that takes longer to develop. Use entry conditions to predict.

Q3: Is +20% target too aggressive?
A:  Median winner is +10.9%, mean is +46.3%. +20% is middle ground that
    captures fast winners but lets winners run. Test sensitivity: +15%, +20%, +25%.

Q4: What about weekend gaps?
A:  Track Friday entries separately. May have worse P&L profiles due to
    overnight gap risk. Consider limiting Friday entries to high-gamma only.

Q5: How do we prevent Day 0 losses?
A:  Fix regime classifier to detect regimes 1 day earlier. This is entry problem,
    not exit problem. Worth significant engineering effort.
