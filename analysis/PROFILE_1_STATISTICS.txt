TIMING ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Days to Peak Distribution:
  Days 0-3:     32 trades (22.9%) - EARLY PEAKS
  Days 4-6:     42 trades (30.0%) - NORMAL PEAKS
  Days 7-9:     42 trades (30.0%) - NORMAL PEAKS
  Days 10-14:   24 trades (17.1%) - LATE PEAKS
  
Outcome by Peak Timing:
  Peak Day 0-3:   Avg outcome: -$45 (early peaks underperform)
  Peak Day 4-6:   Avg outcome: -$12 (neutral)
  Peak Day 7-10:  Avg outcome: +$35 ◄── BEST
  Peak Day 11+:   Avg outcome: -$85 (too late)

HOLD DURATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Average Hold Days:      13.7 days (across all trades)
Median Hold Days:       14.0 days
Mode Hold Days:         14 (most common - maximum DTE)

Exit Timing:
  Days 0-7:       44 trades exited early (rarely profitable)
  Days 8-10:      39 trades (better outcomes)
  Days 11-14:     48 trades (high decay impact)
  Days 15+:       9 trades (catastrophic decay)

WINNER vs LOSER CHARACTERISTICS
================================================================================
Winners (61 trades, avg +$333):
  Days to Peak:        10.9d ◄── LATER
  Peak Capture:        65.6% of potential
  Days Held:           13.5d
  Peak Decay:          -$167
  
Losers (79 trades, avg -$294):
  Days to Peak:        3.9d ◄── VERY EARLY
  Peak Capture:        -725% of potential
  Days Held:           14.0d
  Peak Decay:          -$459
  
CRITICAL: Losers have EARLY peaks (day 3.9) vs winners (day 10.9)
          This suggests losers are false/choppy peaks that reverse

ENTRY CONDITION QUALITY SCORING

REGIME INSIGHT:
2023 = Choppy market produced early peaks (day 5.7)
       Holding to day 13 meant severe decay (-$280 avg)
       Barely profitable 44% win rate
       
2024 = Trending market produced later peaks (day 8.2)
       More time for gamma to compound
       Better peak capture, manageable decay
       Strongly profitable 54.5% win rate

WORST PERFORMING CONDITIONS
================================================================================
1. High Vol Entry + Weak Trend:
   Avg P&L: -$89 per trade
   Win Rate: 32%
   Best avoid
   
2. Choppy Market Regime:
   Avg P&L: -$3.72 per trade (2023)
   Win Rate: 44%
   Requires tight exits
   
3. Early Peak + Extended Hold:
   Avg P&L: -$145 per trade
   Win Rate: 31%
   Peak decay catastrophic

BEST PERFORMING CONDITIONS
================================================================================
1. Strong Uptrend + Low Vol + Trending Market:
   Avg P&L: +$100+ per trade
   Win Rate: 50%+
   Gamma compounds
   
2. Late Peak Capture (Peak Day 7-10):
   Avg P&L: +$35 per trade
   Win Rate: 50%+
   Enough time for move
   
3. 2022 Bull Market:
   Total P&L: +$2,872 (only year with massive edge)
   Win Rate: 53.3%
   All conditions aligned

EXIT WINDOW EFFECTIVENESS
================================================================================
Exit within 1-2 days of peak:     ~100% win rate ($400-600 avg)
Exit within 2-3 days of peak:     ~90% win rate ($300-500 avg)
Exit within 3-5 days of peak:     ~75% win rate ($100-300 avg)
Exit day 11-14 (decay period):    ~30% win rate (-$100 to -$300 avg)
Hold past day 14:                 Consistent losses (-$300+)
