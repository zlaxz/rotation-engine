## Entry Checklist (Skip if ANY triggered)

- [ ] RV20 > 15% → **SKIP** (13.7% lower win rate)
- [ ] Slope < +0.03 → **SKIP** (no uptrend momentum)
- [ ] ATR5 > 6.5 → **SKIP** (realized vol too high)
- [ ] 5-day return negative → **SKIP** (no recent momentum)

If all green: **TRADE IT**

## Daily Management Checklist

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Entry (Day 0)** | Record entry, set peak alerts, monitor hourly |
| **Day 1-2** | Choppy markets often peak here; watch closely |
| **Day 3-4** | Check for early peak; exit if marked |
| **Day 5-6** | Most common peak window; high alert |
| **Day 7-10** | Trending markets peak here; monitor daily |
| **Day 11-14** | Theta accelerates; exit if not exited |
| **Day 15+** | **MANDATORY EXIT** (theta kills everything) |

---

## Peak Detection Signals

Exit when ANY of these fire:

1. **Volatility Peak:** TTM volatility crosses down or ATR turns negative
2. **Price Peak:** Swing high formed and broken below
3. **P&L Peak:** Position P&L reverses from positive to negative
4. **Greeks Peak:** Gamma turns negative (position deltas out of balance)

---

## The Math

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Exit day 3-4 (peak) | ~$300-500 profit |
| Exit day 6-8 (peak) | ~$400-600 profit |
| Exit day 9-10 (peak) | ~$300-400 profit |
| Hold day 11-14 (decay) | ~-$100 to -$300 loss |
| Hold day 15+ | Certain loss -$400+ |

**Rule:** Peak happens days 5-9. If you don't catch it by day 9, close the trade.

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Let it run for more profits" after the peak
❌ "Average down" after a loss
❌ Hold past day 14 "waiting for theta to reverse"
❌ Enter during RV20 > 15% spikes
❌ Trade without understanding market regime
❌ Ignore early peaks hoping for bigger ones later
❌ Use ATM straddle in weak trends

---

## What TO Do

✅ Exit within 2-3 days of peak (regime-dependent)
✅ Use peaks as sell signals (don't hold through them)
✅ Scale position size based on vol entry regime
✅ Adjust exit window based on market trend
✅ Set daily alerts for peaks starting day 3
✅ Close ALL positions by day 14-15
✅ Skip entries during vol spikes (RV20 > 15%)

## Emergency Override Rules

If trade is down 30%+ from entry cost:
→ Exit immediately (don't wait for peak)

If 10 days have passed with no peak:
→ Exit at any profit (gamma has flat-lined)

If market regime changes mid-trade:
→ Re-evaluate exit window (may need to tighten)

If RV20 spikes above 20%:
→ Exit TODAY (vol crush coming, decay will accelerate)
