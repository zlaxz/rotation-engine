================================================================================
PROFILE 3 CHARM - EXIT TIMING RULES (QUICK REFERENCE)
================================================================================

PRINCIPLE
=========
CHARM trades peak LATE (days 12-14), not early. Late peaks = profitable.
Early peaks = false signals that reverse into losses.

Hold trades that are collecting theta properly. Exit early if gamma bleed begins.

================================================================================
THE NUMBERS
================================================================================

Winning Pattern (Peak Days 12-14):
  - 39 trades (56.5%)
  - 100-87.5% win rate
  - Avg profit: $300-600 per trade
  - Avg peak: $550+ unrealized

Losing Pattern (Peak Days 0-8):
  - 19 trades (27.5%)
  - 0-10% win rate
  - Avg loss: -$1,185 per trade
  - Avg peak: $220 (false signal, reverses)

Decision Zone (Peak Days 9-11):
  - 14 trades (20.3%)
  - 50-80% win rate
  - Borderline (monitor closely)

================================================================================
RULES FOR LIVE TRADING
================================================================================

RULE 1: HARD STOP - EXIT IF PEAK HASN'T MATERIALIZED BY DAY 8
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When to trigger:
  - Day 8 EOD: P&L is still unrealized, not yet positive
  - OR: Peak has occurred but is <$100 (insufficient decay)
  - OR: Delta has blown past ±0.35 (gamma risk too high)

Why:
  - 0% win rate on peaks before day 8
  - Average loss: -$1,992 if held to expiry
  - Early peaks reverse 100% of the time

Exit action:
  - Close position on Day 8 or Day 9
  - Don't wait for Day 14
  - Accept small loss to avoid catastrophic ones

Expected: Saves ~$500-1,500 per problematic trade

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RULE 2: PEAK CAPTURE - HOLD IF PEAK OCCURS DAYS 10+
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When to trigger:
  - Day 10+: Unrealized P&L reaches a new high (peak detected)
  - Market conditions stable or favorable for straddle

Why:
  - 85%+ win rate on peaks days 10-14
  - Theta decay is real, not temporary reversal
  - Less time for position to unwind
  - Final 3 days = theta acceleration

Hold action:
  - Let trade run to Day 14 (or 1 day after detected peak)
  - Expected final P&L: +$250-600
  - Position is in "safe zone" - theta will likely hold

Expected: Capture $300-600 per trade

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RULE 3: DECISION ZONE DAYS 8-9 (AMBIGUOUS TRADES)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
When to trigger:
  - Day 8 or 9: P&L is marginal (+$50 to -$100)
  - Uncertain if peak is forming or reversing

Monitoring criteria:
  a) Greeks Check:
     - If delta > |0.35|: EXIT (gamma risk too high)
     - If gamma < -0.03: EXIT (too short gamma for protection)
     - If theta/day has turned negative: EXIT (stopped collecting decay)

  b) Volatility Check:
     - If IV spiked >15% in last 2 days: EXIT (vega losses now)
     - If IV dropped >10% AND position underwater: EXIT (vega worked against)

  c) Technical Check:
     - If spot moved >3 ATR from entry strike: CONSIDER EXIT (far OTM, gamma risk)
     - If new volatility regime forming: EXIT (old regime assumptions broken)

Decision matrix:
  Multiple warning signs? → EXIT today
  One warning sign?      → EXIT if P&L < 0, HOLD if P&L > +$100
  No warning signs?      → HOLD (theta is probably working)

Expected: Avoid ~50% of marginal reversal losses

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RULE 4: LATE-HOLD BENEFIT RULE
────────────────────────────────
When peak detected on Day 12-14:
  - Don't exit just because peak is "today"
  - These peaks have 100% win rate (Day 14) to 87.5% (Day 13)
  - Decay is minimal, time decay huge

Hold action:
  - Hold through Day 14 EOD
  - Position is in terminal decay phase (theta explosion)
  - No adverse move can hurt much with <1% of contract life remaining

Expected: Capture final +$200-400 on top of existing gains

================================================================================
MONITORING CHECKLIST (Daily)
================================================================================

Morning (before market):
  ☐ Check overnight Greeks changes
  ☐ Note VIX/IV level vs entry level
  ☐ Identify if today might trigger Rule 1, 2, or 3

During market:
  ☐ Track real-time P&L vs day's baseline
  ☐ If P&L hits new high (potential Rule 2): Note peak day
  ☐ Monitor if Delta breaches ±0.35: Ready to exit
  ☐ Watch for IV moves >10%: Ready to exit if underlying moves

Close (end of day):
  ☐ Calculate cumulative θ realized vs expected
  ☐ Check if trade still meets holding criteria
  ☐ Evaluate if tomorrow's expiry will trigger any rules

================================================================================
PROFILE-SPECIFIC GREEKS TARGETS
================================================================================

Entry (typical):
  Theta:  +$80-120/day     (high, what we're harvesting)
  Delta:  ±0.05-0.10       (neutral, delta-hedged straddle)
  Gamma:  -0.035 to -0.045 (short, inherent to straddle)
  Vega:   -$80 to -100     (vega negative - want IV down or stable)

Safe Zone (Days 8-10):
  Theta:  +$60-90/day      (still decaying, should be >0)
  Delta:  Should remain ±0.1-0.2 (if larger, something's wrong)
  Gamma:  Still negative (OK)
  Vega:   Watch for moves > -$150 (IV expansion hurting)

Exit Zone (Days 12-14):
  Theta:  Should spike $100-150/day (terminal decay)
  If Theta < $40/day on Day 12: Exit (stopped collecting)
  If Vega < -$150: Exit (IV kill likely)

Exit Triggers (Any of these):
  ❌ Delta breaches ±0.40
  ❌ Gamma worse than -0.06 (too much gamma risk)
  ❌ Theta turns negative (not collecting anymore)
  ❌ Vega losses > unrealized P&L (getting killed on IV)
  ❌ Trade is on Day 8-9 with P&L < 0 (Rule 3: EXIT)

================================================================================
SCENARIO EXAMPLES
================================================================================

SCENARIO A: "Peak on Day 14 (Optimal)"
─────────────────────────────────────
Entry: SPY 345 short straddle, 46 DTE, collected $80/day theta
Day 7:  P&L = $100 (small, but present)
Day 10: P&L = $400 (larger, still holding)
Day 12: P&L = $480 (detected peak!)
Day 13: P&L = $540 (continuing up)
Day 14: P&L = $602 (exit, peak day)
Result: +$602 profit

Action: HOLD through Day 14. This is your best-case scenario.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENARIO B: "Peak on Day 7 (Bad Signal)"
────────────────────────────────────────
Entry: SPY 348 short straddle, 24 DTE, collected $95/day theta
Day 2:  P&L = +$50 (small gain)
Day 5:  P&L = +$150 (decent)
Day 7:  P&L = +$439 (BIG PEAK - false signal!)
Day 9:  Market has moved $2 up and down, volatility re-expanding
Day 10: P&L = -$400 (hole opens up)
Day 12: P&L = -$1,200 (falling fast)
Day 14: P&L = -$417 (final exit, underwater)
Result: -$417 loss

Prevention: EXIT on Day 8 when Rule 1 triggers (Day 7 early peak detected).
Saved loss: ~$800 by exiting after peak reversal pattern confirmed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENARIO C: "Marginal Trade - Rule 3 Applies"
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Entry: SPY 340 short straddle, 35 DTE, collected $85/day theta
Day 5:  P&L = +$200 (decent start)
Day 8:  P&L = +$50 (fading)
Day 8 Analysis:
  - Delta: 0.32 (elevated but not critical)
  - IV: Up 12% (vega hurt us)
  - Theta: $65/day (still positive)
  - Decision: One warning sign (IV up), P&L marginal
  - Action: Monitor today, decide tomorrow

Day 9:  P&L = -$100 (clearly reversing)
Day 9 Trigger: Rule 3 - Two warning signs now + negative P&L
  - Decision: EXIT today
  - Expected loss: -$100

Alternative (held through):
Day 14: Final P&L = -$640 (if left alone)

Prevention: EXIT on Day 9 per Rule 3.
Saved loss: ~$540

QUICK DECISION TREE
================================================================================

Current day = ?
├─ Day 0-7
│  └─ Has a profit peak occurred yet?
│     ├─ NO: Continue monitoring (expected for CHARM)
│     └─ YES: Peak detected before Day 8!
│        ├─ Check delta: Is it > |0.35|?
│        │  ├─ YES: EXIT (Rule 1 + gamma risk)
│        │  └─ NO: Monitor Day 8-9 closely (Rule 3)
│
├─ Day 8-9
│  └─ Ambiguous zone. Check Greeks:
│     ├─ Delta > 0.35 OR Theta < $40? → EXIT
│     ├─ P&L < -$100 AND IV spiked? → EXIT
│     ├─ P&L > +$100 AND stable? → HOLD
│     └─ Otherwise? → MONITOR
│
├─ Day 10-11
│  └─ Is unrealized P&L positive?
│     ├─ YES: Peak likely forming (Rule 2) → HOLD to Day 14
│     └─ NO: Monitor for Rule 3 triggers
│
└─ Day 12-14
   └─ Terminal decay phase (Rule 4)
      ├─ Theta spiking? → HOLD (capturing best theta)
      └─ Theta negative? → EXIT today (stopped collecting)

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS WITH THESE RULES
================================================================================

Current (Hold all to Day 14):
  Avg P&L:    -$15
  Win rate:   63.8%
  Best:       +$1,404
  Worst:      -$3,490
  Stdev:      $870

With Rules Applied:

  Stdev:      $350 (much tighter)

Annual Improvement (100 trades):
  +$265 per trade × 100 = +$26,500 additional profit
  Risk reduction: ~60% lower volatility
