# SYSTEMATIC INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR - FAMILY STAKES

**Date:** 2025-11-18
**Status:** REPAIR IN PROGRESS
**Stakes:** Family financial security - ZERO tolerance for shortcuts

---

## THE MISSION

Methodically fix EVERY bug found by 10-agent audit swarm.
Verify EACH fix with independent DeepSeek agent.
Prove whether $348K peak potential is real or phantom.
Document EVERYTHING.

---

## CURRENT STATE

**Peak Potential:** $348,897 (2020-2024, 604 trades)
**Current P&L:** -$6,323 (with bugs + dumb exits)
**Capture Rate:** 0.3%

**Critical Question:** Are the peaks real?
- If YES → Fix exits, capture $209K-$279K (60-80%)
- If NO → Peaks are bug-inflated, real edge much smaller

---

## REPAIR PROCESS

**Method:** Fix ONE bug → Verify with agent → Document → Next bug

1. Create complete bug inventory (all 10 agents)
2. Sequence by dependency (what blocks what)
3. Fix bugs one-by-one in order
4. After EACH fix: Independent DeepSeek verification
5. After ALL fixes: Re-run backtest, measure delta
6. Statistical validation of cleaned results
7. Final verdict: Real or phantom?
