AUDIT ROUND 2: VERIFY FIXES + FIND REMAINING BUGS

This round audits the FIXED code to:
1. Verify 15 fixes are correct
2. Find bugs we missed in Round 1
3. Find bugs our fixes introduced
4. Iterate until PERFECT

Method: 10 DeepSeek agents audit FIXED codebase
Cost: ~/bin/zsh.10 per round (worth it for perfection)
Stakes: Family's future - zero tolerance for remaining bugs
